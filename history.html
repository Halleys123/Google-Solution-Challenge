          In the 1970s, the Stockholm United Nations Conference on the Human
          Environment highlighted the importance of sustainable development that
          takes natural environment into account. This event laid the groundwork
          for the concept of sustainable cities and the idea of creating cities
          that can endure over time.

        <p class="content">
          In 1987, the Brundtland Commission published “Our Common Future” which
          outlined the definition of sustainable development as “filling the
          requirements of the present without compromising the ability of future
          generations to meet their own needs.” This definition provided a
          foundation for cities to pursue sustainable development strategies
          that would ensure the wellbeing of their citizens and the environment.

        <p class="content">
          In the 1990s, as urbanization expanded, the term “sustainable cities”
          became popular. Cities were faced with numerous challenges such as air
          pollution, traffic congestion, and energy consumption, among others.
          This gave rise to the need for sustainable development strategies that
          could address these issues.

          In 1992, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
          in Rio de Janeiro further highlighted the importance of sustainable
          development at the local level. This event was a major turning point
          in the history of sustainable cities as it provided a platform for
          cities to collaborate and share their experiences in the pursuit of
          sustainable development.

          In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals were established by the
          United Nations. These goals outlined the vision of cities to be
          inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable by 2030. This provided a
          framework for cities to adopt sustainable development strategies and
          create cities that can be enjoyed by future generations.
