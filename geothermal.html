      <p class="subHead first">What is Geothermal Power?</p>
      <p class="text">
        Geothermal power is an energy generated from heat stored in the Earth.
        It is a renewable form of energy that uses the Earth's internal heat to
        generate electricity. Geothermal energy is used to generate electricity
        or provide direct heat for a variety of applications, including
        residential and commercial heating. The energy can also be used to
        produce hot water for bathing or other uses.
      </p>

      <p class="subHead">What are Geothermal Power Plants?</p>
      <p class="text">
        Geothermal power plants use the Earth's natural heat to produce
        electricity. These plants use a network of pipes, called a heat
        exchanger, to extract heat from deep within the Earth. This heat is then
        used to generate steam, which is used to turn a turbine to generate
        electricity. Geothermal power plants are typically located near areas of
        high geothermal activity, such as volcanoes, geysers, hot springs, and
        other naturally occurring sources of heat.
      </p>
      <p class="subHead">When did these start?</p>
      <p class="text">
        The use of geothermal energy to generate electricity dates back to the
        early 1900s, when the first geothermal power plant was built in Italy.
        Since then, geothermal power plants have been built around the world,
        with the first large-scale commercial plant opening in the United States
        in 1960.
      </p>
      <p class="subHead">What is the history of Geothermal Power?</p>
      <p class="text">
        Geothermal power has been used for centuries for heating and bathing.
        The ancient Romans were the first to harness geothermal energy for these
        purposes. In more recent times, geothermal power has been used to
        generate electricity since 1904, when the first geothermal power plant
        was built in Larderello, Italy. Since then, geothermal power plants have
        been built in many countries, including the United States, Iceland, and
        New Zealand.
      </p>
      <p class="subHead">How is term Geothermal power coined?</p>
      <p class="text">
        The term "geothermal power" was coined in the early 20th century by
        American engineer J.B. Griggs. He used the term to describe the use of
        geothermal energy to generate electricity. The word "geothermal" comes
        from the Greek roots geo, meaning "Earth," and therme, meaning "heat."
      </p>
      <p class="subHead">
        How much Geothermal electricity is being used currently and worldwide?
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Currently, geothermal energy provides around 0.3% of the world's
        electricity. However, it is estimated that geothermal energy has the
        potential to provide up to 10% of the world's electricity. Countries
        such as the United States, Iceland, and New Zealand are some of the
        leading users of geothermal energy for electricity generation.
