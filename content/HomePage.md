## Renewable Energy <!-- Main Heading -->

### Context

Renewable energy sources are those that can naturally replace or regenerate themselves without the threat of running out. Energy from sun, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass sources are among them. They are regarded as environmentally beneficial and sustainable alternatives to non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels, which are limited and quickly running out while also being a significant source of pollution and climate change. With less reliance on non-renewable energy and lower carbon emissions, renewable energy sources are gaining popularity as a feasible response to the global energy dilemma.
