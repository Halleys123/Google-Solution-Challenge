## 1970s:

In the 1970s, the Stockholm United Nations Conference on the Human Environment highlighted the importance of sustainable development that takes natural environment into account. This event laid the groundwork for the concept of sustainable cities and the idea of creating cities that can endure over time.

## 1987:

In 1987, the Brundtland Commission published “Our Common Future” which outlined the definition of sustainable development as “filling the requirements of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” This definition provided a foundation for cities to pursue sustainable development strategies that would ensure the wellbeing of their citizens and the environment.

## 1990s:

In the 1990s, as urbanization expanded, the term “sustainable cities” became popular. Cities were faced with numerous challenges such as air pollution, traffic congestion, and energy consumption, among others. This gave rise to the need for sustainable development strategies that could address these issues.

## 1992:

In 1992, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro further highlighted the importance of sustainable development at the local level. This event was a major turning point in the history of sustainable cities as it provided a platform for cities to collaborate and share their experiences in the pursuit of sustainable development.

## 2015:

In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals were established by the United Nations. These goals outlined the vision of cities to be inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable by 2030. This provided a framework for cities to adopt sustainable development strategies and create cities that can be enjoyed by future generations.
