### Solar power

The term "solar energy" describes energy that comes from the sun's rays. It is a renewable energy source that is the most prevalent and easily accessible type of energy on earth. Solar panels are used to capture solar energy because they turn sunlight into usable electricity for buildings and houses. Moreover, solar energy can be used for cooking, heating water and air, and other tasks that call for heat or power. Using solar energy can assist in reducing the dependency on fossil fuels, which are limited resources and have detrimental effects on the environment.
