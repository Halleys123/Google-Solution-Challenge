### Wind Power <!-- Main Heading -->

Wind energy refers to the process of harnessing the power of wind to generate electricity. This is done using wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electrical power. The wind turbines typically consist of three blades, which are attached to a rotor. When the wind blows, the rotor turns, generating electricity that can be used to power homes, businesses, and other facilities. Wind energy is a renewable source of energy, as wind will continue to blow as long as there is solar energy heating the Earth's surface.
