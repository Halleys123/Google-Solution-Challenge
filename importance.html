      <p class="head">Importance</p>
      <p class="subHead">Why are sustainable cities important</p>
      <p class="text">
        In order to ensure the long-term prosperity of the populace, the
        economy, and the environment, sustainable cities are essential. Here are
        some justifications on why sustainable cities are necessary:
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Sustainable cities are important because they help to reduce
        environmental impacts, protect and improve public health, and create
        more resilient, equitable, and prosperous communities. Sustainable
        cities help to reduce air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions,
        and waste production. They also help to conserve resources, create green
        spaces, and promote sustainable transportation. Sustainable cities can
        also bring economic opportunities, reduce poverty, and improve access to
        healthcare and education. They also foster social inclusion and cultural
        vibrancy. Sustainable cities are key to a more sustainable future.

          <p class="cardHead">Climate Change</p>
          <p class="cardText">
            Cities may lower their carbon footprints and lessen the effects of
            climate change by implementing sustainable policies. Moreover, they
            can adjust to alterations in weather patterns and natural disasters.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <img src="./resources/water.webp" class="cardImg" />
          <p class="cardHead">Water Conservation</p>
          <p class="cardText">
            Sustainable cities should adopt water conservation policies that
            reduce water consumption and waste. This will reduce water costs,
            protect ecosystems, and reduce pollution.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <img src="./resources/housing.webp" class="cardImg" />
          <p class="cardHead">Affordable Housing</p>
          <p class="cardText">
            Sustainable cities should adopt policies that make housing more
            affordable for low-income households. This will reduce inequality
            and enable people to access safe and secure housing.
          </p>

          <p class="cardHead">Green Buildings</p>
          <p class="cardText">
            Sustainable cities should invest in green buildings that reduce
            energy and water consumption. This will reduce operating costs,
            increase comfort levels, and reduce the environmental impact of
            buildings.

          <p class="cardHead">Urban Planning</p>
          <p class="cardText">
            Sustainable cities should adopt urban planning policies that promote
            walkability, public transit, and green spaces. This will reduce
            reliance on cars, create more connected neighborhoods, and make
            cities more livable.

          <p class="cardHead">Environmental benefits</p>
          <p class="cardText">
            Sustainable cities encourage the effective use of resources like
            water, electricity, and materials, which reduces waste and lowers
            costs over time. Public health is given first priority in
            sustainable cities, and as a result, residents have access to parks,
            clean air, and clean water.

          <p class="cardHead">Green Energy</p>
          <p class="cardText">
            Sustainable cities should invest heavily in green energy sources
            such as solar and wind power in order to reduce greenhouse gas
            emissions. This will not only reduce pollution, but will also make
            the city more efficient and reduce energy costs for households and
            businesses.

          <p class="cardHead">Urban Agriculture</p>
          <p class="cardText">
            Sustainable cities should invest in urban agriculture projects that
            improve the local food system. This will reduce food miles, create
            jobs, and improve access to healthy, local food.

          <p class="cardText">
            In order to promote social cohesion and equality, sustainable cities
            guarantee accessibility to basic resources and services like
            housing, transportation, education, and healthcare.
