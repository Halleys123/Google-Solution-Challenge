      <p class="text">
        Tidal power is a form of renewable energy generated from the movement of
        the tides. It is produced by the rise and fall of the ocean's tides and
        can be used to generate electricity. Tidal power plants are structures
        that are built to capture and convert the energy of the tides into
        electricity. They typically consist of a dam or barrier across an
        estuary, bay, or section of the ocean, which captures the water as the
        tide rises and falls. The water is then released through turbines, which
        spin to generate electricity.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Tidal power has been used for centuries to generate power for industry
        and homes. The earliest recorded use of tidal power dates back to the
        11th century in Rome, when mills were powered by waterwheels. The first
        dedicated tidal power plants were built in France in the late 19th
        century.

      <p class="subHead gapTop">History of tidal energy</p>
      <p class="text">
        The term "tidal power" was coined in the 1880s by Winston Churchill, who
        proposed using the tides of the Thames estuary to generate electricity.
        Since then, tidal power has been used in many countries around the world
        to generate electricity. Today, tidal power plants are being developed
        in countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and South Korea.
      </p>
      <p class="subHead gapTop">
        How much hydro energy is being used presently?
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Currently, tidal power is estimated to generate around 0.3 terawatts
        (TW) of electricity worldwide. This is equivalent to around 1% of the
        world's total electricity production. The majority of this power is
        generated in the United Kingdom, Canada, and South Korea.
      </p>
      <p class="text gapBottom">
        In many countries, tidal power is being replaced by wind and solar power
        as the preferred source of renewable energy. This is due to the fact
        that tidal power plants are expensive to build and maintain, and the
        power produced is not consistent due to the unpredictability of the
        tide. Additionally, the environmental impact of tidal power plants can
        be significant, as they can disrupt the natural flow of the sea and
        damage marine habitats.
