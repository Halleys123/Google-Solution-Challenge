      <p class="text">
        Wind energy is a form of renewable energy that is generated by
        harnessing the power of the wind. It is an abundant, clean, and
        sustainable source of energy that can help reduce greenhouse gas
        emissions and combat climate change. The term 'wind energy' was coined
        in the late 1970s, when the modern wind energy industry began to develop
        in response to the energy crisis of the time.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Wind energy has been used for centuries to power sailing ships and grind
        grain into flour. Windmills were a common sight in rural areas during
        the 19th and early 20th century, providing power for pumping water and
        grinding grain. In the late 1970s, the modern wind energy industry began
        to develop in response to the energy crisis of the time.

      <p class="subHead gapTop">Significance of Wind Energy</p>
      <p class="text">
        Wind energy is an important source of renewable energy and can
        significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. It is a clean,
        sustainable, and abundant energy resource that can help reduce
        greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Wind power is also
        cost-competitive with other forms of energy, and it can be used to
        generate electricity in both onshore and offshore locations.
      </p>
      <p class="subHead gapTop">Working of Wind Energy?</p>
      <p class="text">
        Wind energy is generated by the movement of air, which is caused by the
        unequal heating of the earth's surface by the sun. When air is heated,
        it rises and forms an area of low pressure. This low pressure area then
        draws in air from the surrounding high-pressure areas, creating wind.
        Wind turbines use this wind to generate electricity.
      </p>
      <p class="text gapBottom">
        Wind energy is a renewable energy source that is becoming increasingly
        popular due to its clean and efficient nature. It is being used all over
        the world to power homes and businesses and is expected to continue
        growing in the future.
