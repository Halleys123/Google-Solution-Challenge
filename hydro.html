      <p class="subHead">What is Hydro Energy?</p>
      <p class="text">
        Hydro power is a form of renewable energy that is generated by the force
        of moving water, such as a river or waterfall. Hydro power plants use
        the energy of the moving water to generate electricity. The first hydro
        power plant was built in the United States in 1882 in Appleton,
        Wisconsin.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Hydro power has a long history. The ancient Greeks were the first to use
        it, harnessing the power of water wheels to grind grain and pump water.
        In the late 1700s, the French inventor Bernard Forest de Belidor wrote a
        book that outlined the principles of hydro power and its potential uses.
        In the 1800s, many nations began to construct hydro-electric dams and
        turbines to generate electricity.

      <p class="subHead gapTop">How is Hyrdro Energy Renewable</p>
      <p class="text">
        Today, hydro power is the most widely used form of renewable energy,
        providing about 20% of the world’s total electricity. It is a clean,
        reliable form of energy that does not produce carbon dioxide or other
        pollutants. Hydro power is an important part of many countries’ energy
        mix, and its use is expected to grow in the coming years.
      </p>
      <p class="subHead gapTop">
        How much hydro energy is being used presently?
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Currently, hydro electricity is being used to generate around 16% of the
        world’s total electricity. It is estimated that hydro power plants
        around the world have a combined installed capacity of around 1,000
        gigawatts, which is enough to power around 800 million homes. Hydro
        power is the most widely used form of renewable energy, providing a
        clean and reliable source of energy for many countries.
      </p>
      <p class="text gapBottom">
        In many countries, hydroelectric power is being replaced by other forms
        of renewable energy, such as wind and solar power. These forms of energy
        have become increasingly popular due to their affordability,
        cleanliness, and scalability. Wind and solar energy have also become
        more cost-competitive in recent years, making them more attractive
        alternatives to hydroelectric power.
