      <p class="subHead">What is Solar Energy?</p>
      <p class="text">
        The term "solar energy" describes energy that comes from the sun's rays.
        It is a renewable energy source that is the most prevalent and easily
        accessible type of energy on earth. Solar panels are used to capture
        solar energy because they turn sunlight into usable electricity for
        buildings and houses. Moreover, solar energy can be used for cooking,
        heating water and air, and other tasks that call for heat or power.
        Using solar energy can assist in reducing the dependency on fossil
        fuels, which are limited resources and have detrimental effects on the
        environment.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Solar energy don't just refers to the use of solar panels to generate
        electrical it can also be in the form of heat energy. Solar energy can
        be used to heat water, air, and other things.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Solar energy has been used for centuries in various forms. For example,
        it was used by the Ancient Greeks to heat homes, or the Ancient Chinese
        to make fire. In the 19th century, solar energy was harnessed to produce
        electricity. This was done by using the photovoltaic effect, which is
        the conversion of sunlight into electricity.
      </p>
      <p class="subHead gapTop">How is Solar Energy Renewable</p>
      <p class="text">
        Solar energy is a renewable energy source, meaning it will never run
        out. This is because the sun will not run out of energy anytime soon.
        Solar energy is also a clean energy source because it does not create
        any pollution when it is being used.
      </p>
      <p class="subHead gapTop">
        How much solar energy is being used presently?
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        In terms of usage, solar energy is the fastest growing source of
        renewable energy in the world. According to the International Energy
        Agency, solar energy accounted for 2.6% of the worldâ€™s total electricity
        generation in 2020. This percentage is expected to increase as more
        countries invest in solar energy.
      </p>
      <p class="text gapBottom">
        Solar energy is a renewable energy source that is becoming increasingly
        popular due to its clean and efficient nature. It is being used all over
        the world to power homes and businesses and is expected to continue
        growing in the future.
