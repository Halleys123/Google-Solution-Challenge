      <p class="text">
        Biomass power is the use of organic materials, such as wood,
        agricultural waste, and other biological materials, to generate
        electricity. This renewable energy source is considered carbon neutral,
        meaning it does not contribute to global warming, as the carbon dioxide
        released when biomass is burned is the same amount that was absorbed
        while the material was growing. The burning of biomass is also more
        efficient than burning coal or oil, with higher energy output and fewer
        harmful emissions.

      <p class="subHead gapTop">What are Tidbiomassal Power Plants?</p>
      <p class="text">
        Tidbiomassal power plants are a type of biomass power plant that use
        marine biomass, such as seaweed and kelp, as fuel for generating
        electricity. These plants use a process of anaerobic digestion to break
        down the biomass and release the energy, which is then used to generate
        electricity. These plants are becoming increasingly popular due to their
        low emissions and their ability to produce electricity with a renewable
        source.
      </p>

      <p class="subHead gapTop">When Did These Start?</p>
      <p class="text">
        The first tidbiomassal power plant was constructed in the Netherlands in
        2011. Since then, other countries have started to explore the potential
        of this type of renewable energy source, with the United Kingdom and
        United States being some of the leaders in research and development.
        Currently, there are over 70 tidbiomassal power plants operating around
        the world in countries such as Germany, France, Japan, and the United
        States.
      </p>

      <p class="subHead gapTop">What is the History of Biomass Power?</p>
      <p class="text">
        Biomass power has been used for centuries to provide heat and light, but
        it was not until the early 20th century that it began to be used to
        generate electricity. In the 1920s and 1930s, biomass power plants began
        to be built in Europe and the United States, and in the 1950s, the first
        large-scale biomass power plants began to be constructed. The use of
        biomass to generate electricity then declined in the late 20th century,
        as other sources of renewable energy, such as wind and solar, began to
        become more popular. However, in recent years, biomass power has seen a
        resurgence as countries around the world have started to invest in
        renewable energy sources.

      <p class="subHead gapTop">How is the Term Biomass Power Coined?</p>
      <p class="text">
        The term biomass power was coined in the early 20th century to describe
        the process of using organic matter to generate electricity. It comes
        from the words “bio”, meaning “life”, and “mass”, meaning “material”.
        This term is still used today to describe the process of generating
        energy from organic materials.
      </p>

      <p class="subHead gapTop">
        How Much Biomass Electricity is Being Used Currently and Worldwide?
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Currently, biomass electricity is being used by over 70 countries around
        the world, with an estimated total capacity of over 60 gigawatts. This
        makes it one of the most widely used forms of renewable energy, and it
        is projected to continue to grow in the coming years. In the United
        States, biomass electricity represents about 4% of total electricity
        generation, while in the European Union, it accounts for over 8% of
        total electricity generation.
